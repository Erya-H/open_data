"The paper used Alibaba, an internet-based e-commerce website that covers business-to-business online marketplaces, retail and payment platforms, shopping search engine and data-centric cloud computing services, to study the websites of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) manufacturers in China and describe how they market their products. The coding guide consisted of seven sec- tions with 90 total items, including: (1) basic information about the site, (2) regulatory language, (3) contact information, (4) products, (5) claims, (6) messaging and (7) pro- motion. The study shows that the health-related benefits were claimed most frequently, followed by the claims of no secondhand smoke exposure, and utility for smoking cessation. Better regulation of e-cigarette marketing messages on manufacturersâ€™ websites is needed in China."
